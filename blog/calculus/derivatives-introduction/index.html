            Derivatives are all about slope.<br>
            <span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:italic"><table style="border-collapse:collapse"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Slope = </td><td style="border-bottom:1px solid black">Change In Y</td></tr><tr><td>Change In X</td></tr></tbody></table></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's easy to find the <span style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif;font-style:italic">average</span> slope between two points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Change in X = 15, Change in Y = 24<br>
                Slope = 24/15
            </p>
            <p>
                But how do we find the slope <strong>at a point</strong>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Change in X = 0, Change in Y = 0<br>
                Slope = 0/0 = ???
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why we have differential calculus.<br>
                How does it work? All we do is instead of having one point we have two points that are <strong>infitesimally</strong> close together. Though we can't divide by zero, We can by an infitesimally small number...

                <b>First, let's understand "derivative".</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                e.g. what does it mean for the "derivative" of x<sup>2</sup> to be 2x?<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The derivative of x<sup>2</sup> is 2x</li>
                    <li>If we have a point on the x<sup>2</sup> graph, then the slope of that point is equal to 2 times the x-coordinate of the graph.</li>
                    <li>e.g. (5,25) on the x<sup>2</sup> graph has a slope of 2*5 = 10.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How to calculate derivatives?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: calculate the derivative of f(x) where f(x) = x^2<br><br>
                Slope = f(x+&Delta;x)-f(x)/&Delta;x<br>
